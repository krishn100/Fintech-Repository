# Case Study Proposal
# Brex 

## Overview and Origin
Brex is a financial technology company focused on financial services for business. The company was founded in 2017 by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, two Brazilian entreprenuers. They had initially founded a payments processing company called Pagar.me in Brazil but encountered many difficulties securing a corporate credit card in the United States, despite having ample capital in their business account. The difficulties they faced, helped them identify a gap in the market, specfically for startups and tech companies. 
Brex has currently raised 1.5 Billion dollars over 12 rounds of funding, attracting investments for venture capital firms and other institutional investors.
