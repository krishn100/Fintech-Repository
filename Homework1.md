# Case Study Proposal
# Brex 

## Overview and Origin

Brex is a financial technology company focused on financial services for businesses. The company was founded in 2017 by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, two Brazilian entreprenuers. They had initially founded a payments processing company called Pagar.me in Brazil but encountered many difficulties securing a corporate credit card in the United States, despite having ample capital in their business account. The difficulties they faced, helped them identify a gap in the market, specfically for startups and tech companies. 
To date, Brex has raised 1.5 Billion dollars over 12 rounds of funding, attracting investments for venture capital firms and other institutional investors.  


## Business Activities:

Brex primary focus was to address the challenge startups face when seeking financial services, specifically corporate credit cards. Brex's intended customers are primarily startups and technology companies. As of 2023, Brex has more than 200,000 customers from startups to enterprises which was a 200% increase from the last year. Leveraging a combinattion of cloud computing, Data Analytics and Machine learning, Cybersecurity solutions, Blockchain and Cryptocurriences, and API's, Brex efficiently delivers its services. For application and data they use Amazon Web Services, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront and React. 


## Landscape:

Brex operates within the domain of busness and corporate financial services in the fintech industry. Over the last decade this domain has been digital transformed with the rise of Fintech startups focusing on user experience and efficiency. They have been achieving this through the integration of API's and Open Banking, Data Analytics and AI. With most services being digital there is also a significant emphasis on Cybersecurity. Stripe, Square, Adyen, Divvy and Expensify are some other important companies in this domain. 


## Results

They have many innovative financial solutions such as virtual cards for online transactions, integration with accounting software, and reward programs tailored for business expense. Their innovations have contributed to competition and market differentiation in this business landscape.

Brex made it to the 2nd spot on CNBC's Disruptor 50 in 2023. As of 2022, Brex has been used by 40% of US-based startups. These are some metrics companies in this domain would measure success by.
Expensify, a competitor, had 169.5 million in revenue in 2022 (19% increase) for comparison. 


## Recommendations

My reccomendation for Brex would be to create a business planning software/platform for startups, if they don't already have one. Introducing an AI-backed advisor could provide valuable support for startups in making informed financial decisions. By offering this service, Brex could become even more attractive to smaller startups with limited capital. The service would utilize AI, Data Analytics, API Integrations, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing and more. Data Analytics and AI technologies most importantly, would be crucial for processing large amounts of financial data in real-time and curating insights, providing startups with practical information.
